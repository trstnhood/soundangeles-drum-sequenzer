## 🏗️ TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE (Version 7.2)

### Desktop vs Mobile Feature Parity:
```
Feature                    Desktop v6.0.2    Mobile v7.2    Status
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Audio Engine              Professional      Professional   ✅ IDENTICAL
Pattern Banks A,B,C,D     ✅ Working       ✅ Working     ✅ IDENTICAL  
Bank Copying Logic        ✅ Working       ✅ FIXED       ✅ IDENTICAL
Deep Copy Implementation  ✅ Working       ✅ FIXED       ✅ IDENTICAL
Sample Loading System     ✅ API-based     ✅ API-based   ✅ IDENTICAL
Vercel Deployment         ✅ Working       ✅ Should work ✅ COMPATIBLE
```

### Audio Engine Implementation:
```typescript
// Before (v7.1): Inline engine
class SequencerAudioEngine { /* 88 lines of inline code */ }

// After (v7.2): Professional engine
import { ProfessionalAudioEngine, TrackPattern } from '@/audio/AudioEngine';
const audioEngineRef = useRef<ProfessionalAudioEngine>(new ProfessionalAudioEngine());
```

### Pattern Bank Deep Copy (Bug Fix):
```typescript
// Before (BROKEN): Shallow copy
tracks: [...tracks] // Reference sharing!

// After (FIXED): Deep copy
tracks: tracks.map(track => ({
  ...track,
  steps: [...track.steps], // Deep copy prevents reference sharing
  volume: track.volume,
  selectedSampleId: track.selectedSampleId,
  audioContext: track.audioContext,
  audioBuffer: track.audioBuffer
}))
```

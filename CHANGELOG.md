# üìà SOUNDANGELES DRUM SEQUENZER - CHANGELOG

## üöÄ Version 7.3.2 (2025-09-09)

### üéØ **PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION - CRITICAL UPDATE**
**Major Performance Fix: Rotary Knob Frame Reduction**
- **Before**: 256 PNG frames (0000-0255) causing severe performance issues
- **After**: 24 effective frames (every ~10th frame) for smooth operation
- **Impact**: ~90% reduction in frame loading, dramatically improved responsiveness
- **Affected Components**: All volume knobs (Master + 8 Instrument knobs)

**Technical Details:**
- Modified `/src/components/RotaryKnob.tsx` frame calculation algorithm
- Changed from `Math.floor((value / 100) * 255)` to smart frame stepping
- Uses frames: 0000, 0011, 0022, 0033, ... 0253 (24 total positions)
- Maintains visual smoothness while eliminating performance bottleneck

### üé® **UI PRECISION FIX**
**Instrument Scale Positioning Correction**
- Fixed misaligned `scale_mid_knob_b.png` behind instrument volume knobs
- **Adjustment**: Moved scale 3 pixels up for perfect visual alignment
- **CSS Change**: `translateY(-7px)` ‚Üí `translateY(-10px)`
- **Visual Impact**: Perfect alignment between knobs and their measurement scales

### üîß **Technical Implementation**
```typescript
// New optimized frame calculation in RotaryKnob.tsx
const totalFrames = 24; // Much better performance than 256 frames
const frameStep = Math.floor(255 / (totalFrames - 1)); // ~10-11 step size
const rawFrameIndex = Math.floor((value / 100) * (totalFrames - 1));
const frameIndex = rawFrameIndex * frameStep;
```

### ‚úÖ **Quality Assurance**
- Playwright automated testing confirmed functionality maintained
- Hot Module Reload tested - changes apply instantly
- Cross-browser compatibility verified
- Desktop and mobile versions both optimized

## üéâ Version 7.3.1 (2025-09-09)
**Sample Selection Bug Resolution - Desktop & Mobile Working**

### üîß Critical Fixes Applied:
- Fixed AudioEngine.ts loadSample() bug: Added missing samplePaths registration
- Unified trackId systems between desktop and mobile versions  
- Desktop now uses folder-based trackIds like mobile (01_KICK, 02_SNARE, etc.)
- Sample switching via WippSchalter working on both versions

### üìã Technical Changes:
- **AudioEngine.ts**: Added `this.samplePaths.set(sampleIdOrUrl, sampleIdOrUrl)` in loadSample()
- **SoundAngelesDrumSequencer.tsx**: Updated trackId generation with getTrackIdFromFolder()
- Maintained lazy loading on desktop, aggressive preloading on mobile
- Both versions now fully compatible for cross-device testing

### üéØ Verification:
- Playwright tests confirm both versions working correctly
- Sample selection and playback functional on desktop and mobile
- Ready for production deployment and multi-device testing
